<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Given 79 explanatory variables, an identifier, and a target variable describing 1460 houses in Ames, IA, the objective of this Kaggle competition is to develop a model to accurately predict home sale prices for 1459 homes in the test dataset. A summary of the data can be found <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data">here</a>.</p>
<p>The data are pre-split into training and test data sets. The former has a column with sale prices, while the latter does not.</p>
</section>
<section id="i.-initial-data-cleaning" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="i.-initial-data-cleaning">I. Initial Data Cleaning</h2>
<p>The variables from the raw training data were categorized as character, double, or integer types when read into R. The following cleaning steps were taken prior to a deeper exploration of the data:</p>
<ul>
<li>column names were converted from snake to camel case</li>
<li><em>garage_yr_blt</em> was populated with -1000 if the value was not applicable and NA if missing</li>
<li>not applicable values were populated with a variable-specific character (e.g., “NG” for “no garage”, “NB” for “no basement”) for multiple variables (e.g., <em>garage_type</em>, <em>garage_finish</em>, <em>bsmt_cond</em>, <em>bsmt_qual</em>)</li>
<li>all character variables aside from <em>id</em> were converted to (unordered and ordered) factors (Table 1)</li>
</ul>

<p>Given all of these results, the data do not appear to be MCAR and thus should be considered MAR (note: MNAR would require deeper investigation and gathering more data, which is beyond the scope of this project). Multiple imputation is a reasonable approach for MAR data. The classification and regression tree (‘cart’) approach was used to impute values.</p>

<section id="iv.-feature-selection" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="iv.-feature-selection">IV. Feature Selection</h2>
<p>After a successful imputation of missing values, feature selection was conducted. Here factor variables that display constancy or low ‘variance’ and highly correlated variables were dropped.</p>
<section id="a.-drop-low-variance-features" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a.-drop-low-variance-features">A. Drop low ‘variance’ features</h3>
<p>Low ‘variance’ factor variables means that one category composes at least 98% of the values. Thus, less than 2% of the remaining values for that factor are associated with one or more other categories. There’s a couple reasons to drop these predictors:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>In v-fold cross-validation, there needs to be at least one value of each factor level in each fold. If infrequent factor levels are very rare, then this may not occur or the number of folds may need to be capped at a low number to accommodate this.</li>
<li>Even if item 1 is accomplished, a small number of a given factor level in one or more folds may lead to over-fitting due to small sample size</li>
</ol>
<p>Five factors exhibited constancy: <em>condition2</em>, <em>pool_qc</em>, <em>roof_matl</em>, <em>street</em>, <em>utilities</em> (Table 4).</p>

<p>Table 5 shows that no pair of numerical predictors had a very strong correlation (<em>r</em> &lt; 0.9 for all pairs). Note that this result was unaffected if Spearman rank correlations were used.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Multicollinearity was also assessed for pairs of ordered factors by computing Spearman rank correlations and using the same threshhold for exclusion.</p>

<p>Table 6 indicates that <em>overall_qual</em> and <em>overall_cond</em> are perfectly correlated, so <em>overall_cond</em> was removed. No other pairs of ordered factors had very strong correlations (<em>r</em> &lt; 0.9).</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Multicollinearity among pairs of unordered factors was also investigated using Chi-square tests of independence.</p>

<p>Table 7 shows that nearly all pairwise comparisons were significant at alpha = 0.05. Thus, the most significant pairs should be assessed further to determine which, if any, factors should be dropped.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>After assessing the 10 chi-square test results with the smallest <em>p</em> values, the following comparisons seem to be the most indicative of collinearity among pairs of unordered factors.</p>

<p>Figure 8 illustrates strong patterns of interdependence between <em>ms_sub_class</em> and <em>bldg_type</em> as well as <em>exterior1st</em> and <em>exterior2nd</em>. A review of the 10 comparisons with the smallest <em>p</em>-values (Table 7) indicates that for these two pairs, <em>ms_sub_class</em> and <em>exterior2nd</em> should be dropped. The former is part of the three most significant correlations, and the latter is, by definition, secondary to <em>exterior1st</em>.</p>

<p>Although factors (both unordered and ordered) that exhibited constancy were dropped, many of the remaining ones still contained rare levels. In those cases, the rare levels should be combined together or binned with more common levels such that no level should be considered rare (i.e., composes &lt; 2% of observations). This feature engineering approach was performed for all applicable factors by 1) considering each level’s relationship with <em>sale_price</em>, 2) combining levels by similarity of type, 3) using domain knowledge, and/or 4) simply combining rare levels into some type of ‘Other’ category.</p>

<p>Table 8 shows that category ‘FR3’ occurs less than 0.3% of the time, well below the 2% threshold. Given that ‘FR3’ is so rare, its relationship with <em>sale_price</em> is less important (which is indicative of the large error bars in the top two plots; Figure 9); thus, it was binned with ‘FR2’ (as these are similar in shape and frequency) to make ‘FR2_3.’</p>

<p>Feature scaling is performed on numerical predictors to normalize their ranges such that these predictors do not have a differential impact on the model simply as an artifact of differences in scales (ranges).</p>

<p>All numerical predictors were not normally distributed (<em>p</em> &lt; 0.05) per the results of the Shapiro tests (Table 11).</p>
<p>Thus, given both sets of evidence, normalization is an appropriate feature scaling technique for these predictors. This transformation was applied to the training data.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a.-predict-sale-prices">A. Predict sale prices</h3>
<p>Using the finalized random forest model with <em>trees</em> = 2000 and <em>min_n</em> = 2, the model was evaluated on the test data. The <em>sales_price</em> values were predicted for each row of the test data.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="b.-quantify-performance-on-test-data">B. Quantify performance on test data</h3>
<p>The predicted <em>sales_price</em> values associated with each <em>id</em> were submitted to Kaggle for scoring. This model scored <strong>0.16399</strong>, which is a measure of the RMSE on logged predicted and observed sales prices.</p>
