# **House Prices Regression Project**
Predict housing prices using a machine learning algorithm.

## Summary
This project is from the Kaggle competition [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques). For this exercise, 79 explanatory variables that describe homes in Ames, IA, are used to develop a machine learning model that can predict their sale prices. Specifically, data underwent cleaning, exploration,
imputation (for missing values), and various forms of feature engineering/selection prior to model development, tuning, and ultimately selection. The best model, a tuned random forest model, was then evaluated using the unseen test data.
